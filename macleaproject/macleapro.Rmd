The goal of this project is to predict how the subjects did the exercise based on predictors

```{r}
# read the training file in
tr=read.csv("pml-training.csv")
preProc=preProcess(tr[,7:159],method="pca")
trainPC=predict(preProc,a[,-1])
modelfit=train(a$diagnosis~.,method="glm",data=trainPC)
#train 69 without the +1, only 70 wit +1 - answer s/b .71
testPC=predict(preProc,testing[,58:69])
confusionMatrix(testing$diagnosis,predict(modelfit,testPC))
